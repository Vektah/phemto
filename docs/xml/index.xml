            <p>
                In jargon speak, <em>Phemto</em> is a lightweight, highly automated,
                dependency injection container.
                In simpler terms, <em>Phemto</em>'s job is to create objects from as
                little information as possible; dramatically reducing coupling within
                an application or framework.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why is this useful?
                Creating objects in your application with hard code <code>new</code>
                statements is very explicit, but it makes things difficult to change later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take this code...
<php><![CDATA[
class MyController {
    function __construct() {
        ...
        $connection = new MysqlConnection();
    }
}
]]></php>
                Easy to understand, but you can only ever use a MySQL database in this
                application.
